# d3d9-Render-to-Texture
Example of Rendering to Texture via D3D9

Creates an 8x8 checkerboard texture with the first pixel as a greenish color. Slowly scrolls the image to the right over time. Renders the geometry onto an off-screen texture, then renders that off-screen texture as a full-screen quad.
